    description: "Apple iPhone 13 features a brilliant combination of 12 MP (wide camera) and 12 MP (ultra-wide camera). Both the cameras take outstanding shots with absolute clarity. Filmmakers use a technique called rack focus - shifting focus from one subject to another - to guide the audienceâ€™s attention in their movies. Now iPhone makes it easy for you to bring the same storytelling technique to your videos. "
